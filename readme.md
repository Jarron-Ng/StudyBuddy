# 1D project - StudyBuddy
Our app created for ***50.001 Information system and Programming*** module. 

***StudyBuddy*** is targeted toward students to keep track of their work at hand and develop good study habits using a pomodoro timer.


As with all androidstudio projects, java scripts are located in app/src/main/java
We have a models folder that contains all our model objects used for recycler view and to create our own Task object.


### Files and their usage in /myapplication
- /models: Utility files to support recycler view and to specify our own Tasks Class/Object
- *AddTask.java*: Adds a task object to firestore and to explore.java
- *Login.java*: An adapter that holds our fragment activity for the login/signup page
- *loginFragment.java*: Handles user logins and firebase authentication
- *signupFragment.java*: Handles user signups and firebase storage
- *startup.java*: Start up page when app is first pressed
