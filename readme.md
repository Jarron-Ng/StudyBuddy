# 1D project - StudyBuddy
Our app created for ***50.001 Information system and Programming*** module. 

***StudyBuddy*** is targeted toward students to keep track of their work at hand and develop good study habits using a pomodoro timer.


As with all androidstudio projects, java scripts are located in app/src/main/java
We have a models folder that contains all our model objects used for recycler view and to create our own Task object.
